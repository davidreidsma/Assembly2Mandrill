# Assembly2Mandrill

WIP

This translates an Assembly XML plugin file to code that you can copy and paste into a Mandrill tag definition with few changes.

Syntax:
```Assembly2Mandrill.exe <input file path> <output file path>```

You'll need to fix things such as tag references and some naming, and if there are any types that I haven't defined, you'll have to fix those as well.

I don't have a 100% understanding of the word vs. int data types, so there might be problems there. That might be ok, though; I think Assembly uses ints for both so it's up to user discretion anyway.
